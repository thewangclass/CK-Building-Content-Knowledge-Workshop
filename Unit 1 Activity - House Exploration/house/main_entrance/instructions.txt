Hello friendly neighbor! 

Thank you for your willingness to help watch my house
while I am gone!

I left this note to provide you with some reminders
of tools you can use to watch my house

If you need help, remember your CLI commands:

cd changes directory
ls lists the files and directories in the current directory
pwd prints the current directory
mkdir makes a new directory
touch creates a new file
nano edits a file
rm deletes a file/directory
help information on a command
clear clears the screen
tab autocompletes
up-arrow goes back to last command
